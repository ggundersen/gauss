		<h4>Problem statement</h4>
		<p>
			"Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:<br>
			1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br>
			By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms."

		<h4>Visualization</h4>

			Input: a divisor (integer)<br>
