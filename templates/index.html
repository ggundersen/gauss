    <h3>Gauss</h3>
    <h4>Intro</h4>
    <p>
    	Gauss is a web application for standardizing, testing, and analyzing <a href='http://projecteuler.net/'>Project Euler</a> solutions. All calculations are performed at runtime.

    <h4>The <span class='code'>gmath</span> library</h4>
    <p>
        While Project Euler problems are standalone, many of them rely on common mathematical functions. These recurring functions are abstracted away by the <span class='code'><a href='https://github.com/ggundersen/Project-Euler/blob/master/gmath.py'>gmath</a></span> library, resulting in cross-problem performance gains. For example:
        <span class='code block'>
        def factorial(n):<br>
            <span class='indention'>
            if n == 1:<br>
                <span class='indention'>return 1<br></span>
            else:<br>
                <span class='indention'>return n * factorial(n-1)</span>
            </span>
        </span>
        was eventually rewritten to be:
        <span class='code block'>
            def get_factorial(n):<br>
            <span class='indention'>
                facts = [1, 1]<br>
                for i in range(2, n+1):<br>
                    <span class='indention'>facts.append(facts[i-1] * i)<br></span>
                return facts[n]
            </span>
        </span>
        The latter is orders of magnitude faster for larger values of <span class='code'>n</span> and improved multiple problems.
    </p>
    <h4>A mathematical foundation</h4>
    <p>
        Many problems have trivial, brute-force "solutions" that fail due to hitting a computational wall. The primary thrill in solving such problems is discovering that a seemingly unrelated mathematical idea removes the wall entirely. These discoveries are documented.
    </p>
    <h4>&c.</h4>
    	Gauss is being developed on the Google App Engine platform. The application uses the webapp2 framework, Python 2.7, and jinja2.
